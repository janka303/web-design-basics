Birding and birdwatching, what's the diff?
Birding and birdwatching mean the same thing. The activity of observing wild birds. (Birds in cages or any form of captivity don't count.)

What do people do when they go birding?
Birdwatchers observe wild birds in their natural habitat. Birdwatching means learning to identify the birds and understand what they are doing. In North America, there are over 800 species of birds. Wherever you live, you'll probably find at least 100 species that are easy to find in your area. fe suddenly gets more interesting when you become aware of the varied bird fe all around you.

Where do you watch birds?
Birding is something you can do in your own back yard (it's a natural habitat too). Your local park. Anywhere you travel. Or on trips you take specifically to see birds that are in a certain environment, such as on a native prairie in North Dakota, or in the old-growth forest of the Pacific Northwest.

Who watches birds?
People of all ages watch birds. It's an activity you can keep doing all your life, in any part of the world. Birding is the fastest-growing outdoor activity in America. According to a survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 51.3 million Americans report that they watch birds. And more are taking it up all the time.

How can I learn more about birdwatching?
Join a local bird club and go for a walk with other birdwatchers. Subscribe to a magazine devoted to birdwatching, such as Bird Watcher's Digest. Order some DVDs or videos on birdwatching. But don't spend too much time watching the TV screen! Get outside and look at the actual birds. By all means, get your hands on a good bird book (also known as a field guide). Or get two or three. Each one gives you something none of the others has. Most important, start noticing the birds around you.

Why birds?
Birds have always delighted people all over the world because of their beauty and their power of fight. Historically, they used to be considered omens. The ancient Romans believed that the fights and calls of birds cod foretell the future. Today, modern science still uses birds as a kind of oracle. Changes in bird populations can reflect the health of the environment. Some birds are indicator species, like the USA's national bird, the bald eagle. They forecast environmental conditions. The knowledge of birds can help us plan a better, more sustainable relationship with nature.

What's in it for me if I start birding?
Fun. Big fun. Something deep seems to get fulfilled. A connection is made with the immense beauty of nature.
 
Satisfaction. Birding invokes our primeval hunting instincts. It delivers all the satisfaction of the hunt, even though the prey itself escapes unharmed. Birding is the perfect sport for the 21st Century.

Health. Birding gets you vertical. It gets you outside and walking. But it's effortless, because your attention is on the birds. Nevertheless, after a little birding, you've usually covered quite a bit of ground.

Family. Birding unites people across generations. By taking up birding, parents or grandparents can introduce their children to an interest in nature that will stay with them all their lives.

Companionship. Birding is the ideal social activity. A birder need never be lonely. Nearly every community has a birding club of some sort. And because birders love to share their knowledge, newcomers are always welcome.

Solitude. Birding is also the ideal solitary sport. There's a special pleasure in going out alone to bird. Your mind settles down. Your senses open up, and all nature seems to become your friend. Birding is a sport of many moods, and it serves the causes of companionship and solitude equally well.
