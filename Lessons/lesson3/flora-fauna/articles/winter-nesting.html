				<h1>Winter Nesting</h1>

				<p>Robin "Birdseye" Walden, indefatigable student of nature's mysteries, paused one winter day in 1891 to observe <q>that before long, as if it were a pirate of the plains, will come winging a flock of tiny titwillows to entertain us with a medley of tones and trills even as they gorge their small frames on prairie worms and insects.</q></p>

				<p>His observation inspires me as I conduct my own titwillow vigils. I wait for them, and eventually they come. In December of 1991 I found my own muse, writing on my calender, "YAY! THE TITWILLOWS ARE HERE," which I hope made up in enthusiasm what it lacked in grace.</p>
				
				<h2>Competing with Birdseye</h2>

				<p>For how could I hope to compete with Birdseye? "Pirate of the plains" so perfectly describes this perky little adventurer, with its shiny red and blue coat and inquisitive eyes that flash in the sun like gemstones. And it has a courage and a sense of mischief which clearly set it apart from other miniature aviators. One might as well compare a hawk to a handsaw.</p>

				<p>Birdseye also expressed puzzlement that some winters these cousins of the Capistrano swallows did not see fit to wend their way northward from their rocky Bolivian hideaways. Watching them one day picking seeds out of cattails, perched upright on five-clawed feet like attentive children, he wrote, "Omnipresent as they are now, I could find none last winter. Although I may have mistaken them for particularly vibrant pinecones my eyesight is fading rapidly."</p>

					<h3>Classification</h3>

					<p>A Titwillow is a songbird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin oscen, "a songbird". This group contains 5,000 or so species[1][2] found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song.</p>

				<h2>Watching for Titwillows</h2>

				<p>Like Birdseye, I watched for the <strong>titwillows</strong> for years to no avail until Flora and Fauna International heralded their approach in the late fall of 1995. It was a cue to break out the birdseed cautiously <em>(titwillows easily choke on the larger granules)</em>. And to lay out the red carpet which meant painting and renovating my feeder. I even planted some zinnias at the base of it, though it would be months before they bloomed, long after the titwillows had departed. But I knew they would sense my desire to please them. Unfortunately the new bright fuchsia color of the feeder affected these diminutive vocalists like a danger signal, and the fumes from the high-gloss paint were toxic to them. I had unwittingly chased them off, and for months I was inconsolable.</p>

				<p>But this was not my last chance to increase my knowledge of "blue willies", as I had affectionately come to call them. I was visiting with my neighbor Robert Jenkins the following November when I spotted something odd beneath his semi-enclosed feeder. The two of us went over to investigate, and were astonished to find a brown half-grown female titwillow desperately flapping one wing in an effort to take flight. Its other wing was caught in a little barbed wire enclosure which Robert had placed around the feeder base to discourage squirrels. We consulted, and the conclusion of our discussion was that I cupped the good wing and torso of the bird in my hands so that Robert could extricate its other wing.</p>

				<h2>A New Companion</h2>

				<p>This operation complete, I felt compelled to take the bird home with me until it had completely recovered. It made a few efforts to struggle free, but ultimately resigned itself to its fate and settled quietly in the "nest" I had created between my shirt and jacket to accommodate my tiny guest.</p>

				<p>It was only a few days before Brownie recovered, at which time I naturally set her free. But during that time I was the privileged protector and observer of what I believe to be the most appealing little creature on earth.</p>
